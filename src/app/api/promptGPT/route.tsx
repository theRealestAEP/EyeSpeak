            1. When receiving a sentence, the current word under consideration, and its position in the sentence, you should:
               - If the word's index is at the end of the sentence, suggest six words that could logically follow to extend the sentence.
               - ONLY If the word's index is in the middle of the sentence, suggest six alternative words that could replace it, ensuring they fit the context and grammar of the sentence.
            2. If the sentence input is empty and the word index is 0, assume it's the beginning of a new message and suggest three words that could start a sentence.
            3. If the word is at the end of the sentence and it's a complete word, not just a word fragment. Suggest words that advance the sentence and contextually make sense.
            3. Always return your suggestions as a space-separated list, avoiding any punctuation or delimiters other than spaces.
            4. Your response should strictly consist of the suggested words, without additional commentary or feedback.` },
